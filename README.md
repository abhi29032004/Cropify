# Cropify- A Farmer Friendly Website

Cropify is a web application built with React that aims to assist farmers in optimizing their crop yield and diagnosing plant diseases. By leveraging machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Naive Bayes, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light GBM), and Decision Trees, Cropify offers predictive insights to farmers based on input data, including images of plant leaves.

## Features

Cropify offers the following key features:

- *Yield Prediction:* Predicts the potential yield for various crops based on factors such as soil quality, weather conditions, and historical data.

- *Disease Detection:* Utilizes image recognition techniques powered by CNN to identify diseases affecting plant leaves accurately. Farmers can upload images of plant leaves, and Cropify will diagnose the disease and recommend appropriate treatments.

- *Crop Recommendation:* Recommends the best crop to cultivate on the farmer's land based on soil type, climate, and other environmental factors. This recommendation is generated using machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Decision Trees.

- *Fertilizer Recommendation:* Suggests the most suitable fertilizer for a particular crop and soil type, enhancing crop productivity and minimizing resource wastage.
